# Java-Project-2021
So, I created this Java project during the first year of studying Computer Engineering and Informatics.

My name is George Mermigkis, I'm currently (2021) 19 years old and I'm studing CEID in U-Patras Greece. I am a fan of programming, especially project oriented programming and this is one of my first big projects, if someone can say that.
